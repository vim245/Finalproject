# Final Project
## Carbonomics Project
This is my Data Analytics Course final project named Carbonomics.
The analysis explores the relationship between population and GDP, as well as the correlation between greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and GDP over a 20-year period using Python and Tableau.

## The Key aspects of this study include:
Examining the relationship between population and GDP, identifying trends and potential dependencies.
Analyzing the GHG-GDP relationship over two decades for 21 EU countries and assess how industrial growth correlates with environmental impact.
Evaluating the correlation between GHG emissions and GDP through statistical analysis and visualised through Tableau.
Data wrangling and data cleaning is done by using Python and data visualisation is by Tableau.
